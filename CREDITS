The following applies to pam_chroot, which was largely reused to 
write pam_jail:


This version of pam_chroot was originally written by Matthew Kirkwood
(weejock@ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk) and then heavily modified by Ed
Schmollinger (schmolli@frozencrow.org).  Bugs are likely attributable
to Ed, and he's who you should send bug reports to.

The following have contributed code and/or ideas:

Heiko Hund <heiko@ist.eigentlich.net>
	- fix memory leaks, expanded user/group regex support

John Newbigin <jn@it.swin.edu.au>
	- security checks for conf file & chroot directories
